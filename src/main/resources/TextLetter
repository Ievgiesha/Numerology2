When decoding your own name, it's important to realize that in Numerology, each letter in your name has a corresponding number, and that the placement of each letter determines the kind of influence that letter (and its numerological meaning) has on you. To simplify things, we will refer to letters and their numerological meaning rather than discuss the precise numbers they translate into.

The Cornerstone
First, let's look at the Cornerstone. This is the first letter of your name. It provides general insight about your essential personality, and it has a lot to say about your approach to life's speed bumps and open doors. In other words: your Cornerstone is all about how you approach both difficulties and upswings.

The Capstone
The Capstone is the last letter of your name, and, fittingly, it demonstrates your ability to see projects and ideas through to the end. This translates into your "finishing" number. When you look at your Cornerstone and Capstone -- the letters that "bookend" your name -- you can determine how easy it is for you to start and stop important processes and projects. It answers questions like: are you a shaker and a mover? Are you a little bit flaky?

First Vowel
Now look to the first vowel of your first name -- this letter gets to your core. Think of the deepest goals, urges and dreams that drive you in all you do -- this is the letter offers a glimpse into this area of life. But this is a secretive letter, because few people wear what it really is they want on their sleeve. This first vowel in your name indicates something that only your closest friends and trusted family members might know about you ... and it's also a very telling "window" to your soul!

You might know someone who for whatever reason changed the first vowel in their name. Although this is rare, it indicates a person who is uncomfortable with who they really are, at their core.
From A to Z

Here is an alphabetic list to understand your name from Cornerstone to First Vowel to Capstone. You can decode your own name by focusing on these three things. Here's an example: let's say your name is Anna. With "A" as your Cornerstone Letter, you are ambitious about starting new endeavors.
